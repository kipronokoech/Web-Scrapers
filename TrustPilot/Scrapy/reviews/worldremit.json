I then tested again and sent \u00a315 and guess what... the recipient received this. But still my \u00a3155 is being processed since Monday. I used the same means of sending, mobile money mtn. Till today I have no clue when my money will be transferred to the recipient. I have no clue why I can\u2019t receive my money back. I am shocked by the way world remit has handled my case.

I've talked to them as well as one of the agents she talked to suggested that I request the money back, but according to the agent I talked to that was not possible so the agents clearly don't know what they are talking about. They have been unable to restore her Wallet but they can see it and its balance and still they refuse to send her her own money using cash pickup and they refuse to return the money to me as well.

When I contacted the customer service team to understand what the problem is they couldn't give any clear answers. I've also received multiple emails with several different reasons of why my account was closed. E.g. bank card name different than account name (not true), something wrong with the recipient, double accounts and lastly something about using a third party service provider (which I also don't understand, as I've paid with my credit card). I don't understand why the customer service team is just closing someone's account with no clear reason.

Of course the transfer fees and manageable and the transfers are quick. However, every time I transfer the funds to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and additional fee (between 3 -5 %) is incurred when my recipients pick up the cash. Making the transfer fees more expensive for Congo than the traditional western union. Additionally, every time I need to resolve an issue with WorldRemit customer service, it's like climbing mount Everest. They make the IT department a better customer service agents. For example, I recently made a transfer that Airtel in the DRC refused to pay because they couldn't see. Airtel asked that I contact WorldRemit. WorldRemit, in return said that I should contact Airtel. So, I am not sure who of the two I should take to. As a result, my bank is helping me resolve the issue.

But I made a transaction on 30th November which did not reach the recipient due to technical issues with Bank Reservas.  World Remit AGREED TO REFUND the money back to me as I have since sent the recipient money via Leon.  I have raised this NUMEROUS times that I wanted this paid back to me and received numerous promises and messages that this would  be done.  After making me wait 3 full weeks for a refund, World Remit PAID IT TO THE RECIPIENT. I am a good customer too having transferred around $21,000 US dollars in the past 12 months.  You would think that amount of money and 50 plus transactions in the past 12 months would deserve some sort of respect.  But NO - they don't give a damn just empty promises day after day for 3 weeks and then World Remit DEFY the instruction THEY AGREED. I would advise anyone to look at MoneyGram or dare I say it even Western Union. Both are more expensive to use but they don't cheat you out of your money.  Now that the Christmas sending period is over, I will take my obviously paltry $21,000 a year account to another transfer service. AVOID - GO elsewhere. I was asked by WR to modify this complaint. I will definitely NOT modify this as EVERY word is TRUE and I have all the evidence to prove it.   After 3 weeks of continual empty promises this just got worse. DESPITE NUMEROUS  emails requesting the transaction was cancelled and the money returned to me, WR took it upon themselves to DEFY my instructions and a dozen emails and PAID  it to the recipient 3 weeks later. If you want your money to be paid to the intended recipient AVOID WORLD REMIT. They do NOT read anything you tell them, they are a law to themselves and do what they want.

No reason given, was told \"you just have to follow up\" so I uploaded driver's license 7:49 am yesterday while on line with rep.  She stated id was accepted, funds would be released and i would receive an email when funds are released. After i hung up, immediately received email verifying id was approved.   9:30 pm 13 hours later i still had not received email that funds were released.  So  I called back and rep started to tell me id was not approved i told her i had confirmation email that dl was approved, she checked again and apologized stating that i was correct and funds would be released in a few mins.  So the next morning at 8 am checked transaction it was still sitting in the process phase.  So I called again. It is now 24hrs since everything approved and told each time it would be in a few minutes this is now going into four days since process started. so i informed rep I'm not hanging up the phone until the process the money has been released because it's just sitting there saying processing, Arlene was her name and after 25 mins on the phone the process was done.

I am very thankful to World Remit that the money was sent today when my family needed it the most.  However, it was the very first time that I have used World Remit.  It took me several tries to get my documents uploaded, and about 5 representatives on chat to finally get the money sent.  If I had not persevered because I knew how much my family needed the help, I would have sought another option for getting the money to them.  But I had already started a transaction with World Remit and that was either going to get sent today or I was going to ask for a refund because I did not have the extra money to do it again.  Time is very valuable to me.  It should not have taken all morning to get it done.

What appears to happen is when I send the funds there is some sort of glitch between the payment partner in the Philippines and Worldremit. I have followed up with the help desk at Worldremit a number of times via both the online chat (twice) and email (5 times) with the payment reference number of 77103750, I am then told the payment is either \"locked by the payment partner\" or I'm fobbed off,  or told the issue has been rectified. When the payment recipient attempts to pick up the money they are told there is a problem at Worldremit. Based on my recent experiences with this company I would be very hesitant to recommend anyone use it because once a problem arises no one in the company seems to take ownership of the problem or seems to really care. I am now following up with Australian consumer affairs to try and get my money back. Addendum to above. Since this review I have received a number of calls from Diana at Worldremit . Diana provided excellent customer service, kept me up to date at all times and worked with the payment partner to assist to resolve the issue which was caused by a system issue at the payment partners end.

Worst Costumer Service", "review_body": "This is my first time using WorldRemit to send money to a family member in Colombia and let me tell you how this has been a nightmare. I made the transaction on Nov 23 using the cash option as pickup which is advertised as \"within minutes\", I had to call on the 24th because it was still Processing and that's when they asked me to upload my ID and I did, a few hours passed and nothing it was still processing so I called again to see what was going on that's when they reviewed my ID. My family member went to pick up the money, their local partners didn't want to give him the money because it was missing his mother's last name, I kinda understand this part a little bit as that's their regulations in Colombia. I called WorldRemit on the 25th in the morning to update and add the mother's last name, the lady told me everything was fine and he should be able to pick it up in the afternoon, I inform him that and he went on the afternoon and nothing was updated, I called the next day (26th) they told me what happen is they never contact their local partners to allow it till the 27th. My family member went in this morning today (27th) and nothing was updated. I called this morning and they told me the same story that they haven't contacted their local parents and that it should be ready in 30 mins. Mind you this is a service that is supposed to be \"Within Minutes\" and it has been 4 days of my family member making trips to their local partners and nothing has been done.

My suggestion is that the name of the recipient should correspond to the name on the mobile account. This will ensure that payment is not processed Should the details don't match. WorldRemit have a duty of care to ensure this is done before the wrong recipient picks up the money or the the money gets credited into the  wrong account. But this is not the case with WorldRemit as per my recent experience. So, I sent money to James Greedy (not real name) via mobile money and his account number is 971234567(not real number), but due to a typo ,I made an error in inputting the number. I input his number as 971234657 (Truthful Woman's account) and pressed confirm payment. This payment was processed and paid to Mrs Thruthful Woman because I interchanged the 5 and 6 digits on the account number. I should have checked before proceeding but to me this is unacceptable still and is a serious breach of financial conduct on the part of WorldRemit. Lucky enough, and given the urgent use of which the money was intended for, the correct recipient was able to contact the wrong recipient who had to spend an extra $20 to travel to the next town to get this money. I could have lost that money should it have been sent to someone else because Truthful woman would have decided not to answer the phone or give the money back to the rightful owner.", "ID": "5fbb123e5e693f0b10fe1dbf", "CompanyReply": "HI Phocus, Thanks you for your review and to have shared your experience.
